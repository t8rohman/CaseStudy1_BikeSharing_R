# CaseStudy2_BikeSharing_R
In this case study, I am interested in seeing how casual riders and yearly members utilize Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The dataset can be downloaded here: https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html

The data I used is for the 2021 data set, from January to December. After download it, please rename the csv respectively by its year and month, without spaces. For example: "202101.csv" for January, "202102.csv" for February, and so forth.
